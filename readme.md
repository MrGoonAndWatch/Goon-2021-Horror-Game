## About this project

This was a self imposed challenge to write a horror game in one month during October 2021 more or less by myself, live streaming the entire process. As you can probably tell my looking at the game art is not my strongsuit. I Actually learned how to animate in the middle of development just so there wouldn't be static objects moving around.

All in all I'm happy with what I was able to get done, but there is a ton of content I wanted to include that didn't make it in. Since this was an attempt at parodying old school survival horror games I had a lot of jokes and gags that I ran out of time before being able to add them in, plus a lot of basic functionality such as cutscenes and additional weapons.

## Usage / Project Contribution

I am done working on the game included in this repo as it stands on October 31st, 2021, however I may want to pursue a project in the future using some of the base code I have here as a jumping off point.

As far as rights go feel free to re-use, modify, reference, etc. anything in this project aside from content inside folders labels "Third Party" (this must be used per guidelines of their respective owners). You do not need to credit me if utilizing this code or resources in any fashion, and I would be more than delighted to hear that someone got use out of what I've created here.

While I do not offer any support/liability for any bugs/issues you may encounter while attempting to reuse code written here, I will gladly talk about this project and/or discuss related topics while I'm live on my Twitch channel at https://twitch.tv/mr_goonandwatch

## Cut Content / Developer Commentary

- The #1 thing missing from this game is any sort of story. I had planned to put a lot of this in the cutscenes that never made it in, which would be equal parts jokey while also including context to what was going on (albiet a very simple story).
- Related to the above, I really wanted to include a small cast of other characters in the game. One of which would be a mysterious fellow who gets mutated early on in the story, and while he mauls another NPC himself as well as the other human characters continue to act normally as though nothing happened to him.
- I wanted to add a few more weapons to the game, one of which would have been a melee weapon (a knife or something similar). In reference to a bug in the 2019 Remake Resident Evil 2 this weapon would do damage that would be inversely proportional to your current framerate (doing more damage the slower your game was running).
- In the interest of driving players mad with the mechanics I wanted to make the menu actions (Use, Combine, Examine, Discard) randomize their order each time you select an item. There is partial support for this in the code, though there is no mechanism for actually rearranging the options).
- Generally speaking I wanted to add more puzzles in the game. Specifically I was going to add a numerical lock to the hatch release in the Dining Room scene, which was going to be 314 (related to the pie portrait in this room).
- More enemies were also intended. Specifically I wanted to create a "final boss", which would have been the mutated human in your party turning in to "the perfect weapon", only before being defeated in one hit (this is somewhat there but it's just a reskin of the one enemy type).
- There was going to be a small cutscene when you unlock the front door where your key breaks off in the lock. In a panic, a mauled NPC throws you a rocket launcher from the second floor of the Main Hall, which the player would then fire at the front door to unjam the door (it would not blow away, it would simply then just open normally).
- Door loading animations were going to be in the game, and on top of that I wanted to add in some situations where you had to press buttons to open the door and where pressing buttons would cause the animation to take longer.
- Not quite cut content, but the portraits in the halls were originally going to be very dated meme photos, such as disaster girl. During development I switchd this idea over to pre-Renaissance era artwork as it seemed to fit better. In the final version a lot of these got replaced with some inside joke quickly hand drawn images, but there's one still in the Main Hall and the enemy's head texture is one of the other ones.
- Memos / Notes were going to be part of the game as well. Jokes with these varied from an unskippable 30 page memo that was manually narrated, to invoices by contractors for the bizzare things built in the mansion, to a small joke about someone's life fortune being stored in a jewelry box which turns out to be a 5 dollar bill that's used on a vending machine puzzle in another part of the game.
- Item boxes were something that just got cut partially due to save file related bugs, but also just because by the time I cut down the number of rooms in the game I realized there were effectively less than 6 items and you wouldn't really need to store anything.
- This feature partially exists but I didn't quite take it as far as I wanted to. I had a lot of item combination jokes planned, most of them related to accidentally softlocking the player or destroying valuable items such as heals or weapons. As it stands there's some of this in here, like combining anything with a key items turning it in to garbage, an item that reduces your HP to 1.
